# build.properties - project specific property settings
#
#  This file contains overrides for build properties specified in
#  the generic profiles/system.properties.xml file. That file is
#  considered part of the core build system and should not be
#  modified directly. This file is loaded first allowing you to
#  provide your own settings for various value.
#
#  These values represent PROJECT NORMS. To override these values
#  on your local machine, create a "local.properties" file with
#  the values that you want. That file will be loaded first by the
#  build system. As it contains YOUR specific settings, it should
#  not be committed to version control.
