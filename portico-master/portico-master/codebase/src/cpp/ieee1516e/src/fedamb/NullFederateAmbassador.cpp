/**
 * The NullFedereateAmbassador class is defined in the standard RTI/NullFedeateAmbassador.h
 * header file. Unlike every other class in the specification, it is defined purely within
 * the header file and does not require the RTI implementor to add any code (not even a
 * simple destructor implementation).
 *
 * However, if none of our RTI code brings in the header file, then the class, complete with
 * no-op implementation methods, never makes it into our DLL and thus isn't part of our
 * distribution. Thus, when client federates include the header file and go to use it, as
 * they are not defining the "BUILDING_RTI" symbol (given that they're not building and RTI)
 * the class is declared with dllimport, so the linker goes hunting for it. You can probably
 * now see the problem. It's not exported by the RTI library, so it won't be found. Let the
 * linker errors fly.
 *
 * To solve this, we have a simple, empty .cpp file that just brings in the header and thus
 * causes the declaration, with bodies, to be brought in and form part of this compilation
 * unit. We are defining BUILDING_RTI, which means the class will be marked as a dllexport,
 * and thus, our final RTI dll file will, funnily enough, export it so that client federates
 * can find it when they go to compile themselves.
 *
 * What a trial.
