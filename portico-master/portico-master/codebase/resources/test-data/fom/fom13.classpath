# Welcome to the commons bootstrapper classpath config file!!      #
#                                                                  #
# This file is used by the commons Bootstrapper class to configure #
# its runtime classpath and execution information. If must contain #
# at least the "main:" directive pointing the bootstrapper to the  #
# applications main class (that the bootstrapper will execute once #
# it has build a classpath. The other directives are optional but  #
# do provide the main "meat" of the configuration. They are:       #
#                                                                  #
# "path:" - Add the given location directly to the classpath (be   #
#           it a directory of file)                                #
# "scan:" - If the given location is a directory, look inside it   #
#           for any jar,war,ear or zip files and add them to the   #
#           classpath (but not the directory itself)               #
# "deep:" - Works the same as scan, only any sub-directories that  #
#           are found will be looked into as well (as well as any  #
#           sub-directories in those directories, and so on.... )  #
# "prop:" - Sets up a system property. The format of the string    #
#           following "prop:" must be the in the usual format for  #
#           property declarations (key=value)                      #
#                                                                  #
# Comments are specified by the '#' character as you can see, and  #
# any empty lines will also be ignored. Further, any whitespace    #
# at the start or end of a line will be trimmed before processing  #
#                                                                  #
# Enjoy! And file any bugs at http://jira.porticoproject.org       #
